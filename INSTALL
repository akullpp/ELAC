Installation Instructions


Please read README for usage instructions.


The build process was tested with Apache Ant 1.8.1


Instructions:

1. Please get Apache Ant at ant.apache.org and use their installation instructions.

2. Execute Apache Ant with "ant" in the directory where the build.xml resides. What Apache Ant does: it
	a) compiles the source code to ./bin/
	b) creates a ./ELAC.JAR file for usage

3. Additional options are:
	"ant tar": creates an ./ELAC.tar archive of the project
	"ant doc": creates the JavaDocs in ./doc/
	"ant clean": cleans previous builds, i.e. deletes ./doc/ and ./bin/


Notes:
1. During the compile process an "includeantruntime" warning will be displayed. This is an Ant bug.
2. Ant's JavaDoc function is currently broken. 130 Warnings will be created. The JavaDocs will be viewable but some internal references won't be shown.
Although this is a minor issue, we recommend to import the project in Eclipse and run the internal JavaDoc tool for a perfect JavaDoc build.
